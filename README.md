## Introduction
User segmentation is a crucial aspect of understanding your app's user base. By dividing users into segments based on factors like behavior, demographics, or engagement, you can gain valuable insights that enable you to make data-driven decisions.

This repository provides a Python-based approach to performing user segmentation using popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.


## Methods
The following methods are implemented in the notebook:

Data Loading: Load user data from CSV or Excel files.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, clean the data, and perform necessary transformations.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for segmentation.
Scaling: Scale features if necessary for distance-based algorithms.
Segmentation: Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means to group users.
Visualization: Visualize the results using scatter plots, heatmaps, or other relevant visualizations.


## Example
To better understand how to use the code in this repository, let's consider a quick example:
Load your app's user data using the provided functions.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values and cleaning it.
Select relevant features for segmentation, such as user activity and engagement metrics.
Apply a clustering algorithm like K-Means to group users into segments.
Visualize the segments using scatter plots and other suitable visualizations.
The Jupyter Notebook provides detailed explanations and code snippets for each step.
